# SeeSharp-theme

#### New

Solarized and Syntax Only themes added!

### Description

A colourful, vibrant syntax theme specifically for C# language.
Pretty much just went with what I liked, what kept my eyes engaged and what made what I was doing look more interesting than it really was...

I have created Dark, Grey, Blue, Solarized and Syntax only themes.
(Still very much a work in progress)

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, good or bad, changes, anything.
