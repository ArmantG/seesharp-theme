# SeeSharp-theme

## New

Oceanic and Solarized-V2 themes added

### Description

A colourful, vibrant syntax theme specifically for C# language. Pretty much just
went with what I liked, what kept my eyes engaged and what made what I was doing
look more interesting than it really was...

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, good or bad, changes, anything.
