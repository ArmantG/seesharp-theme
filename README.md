# SeeSharp-theme

### Description

A colourful, vibrant syntax theme specifically for C# language. Pretty much just
went with what I liked, what kept my eyes engaged and what made what I was doing
look more interesting than it really was...

Updated Javascript syntax as well...Hopefully it's not too much of a mess.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, good or bad, changes, anything.

Note:
Note sure why, but there is a difference in some colors when using file scoped... I'll look into it.
