A colorful, vibrant syntax theme specifically for C# language.

This is my 1st attempt - so there may be some issues...

#### Activate theme
After clicking on Install, still on the theme page you can click on Set Color Theme.

To activate and manage your themes at any other time, go to your command pallete, or Ctrl+Shift+p, and type Preferences: Color Theme.


**Enjoy!**
