# SeeSharp-theme

## New

Alternative syntax added to try fix the file scoped namespaces issue in some
themes while keeping the keywords and storage modifiers consistant.

### Description

A colourful, vibrant syntax theme specifically for C# language. Pretty much just
went with what I liked, what kept my eyes engaged and what made what I was doing
look more interesting than it really was...

I have created Dark, Grey, Blue, Solarized and Syntax only themes. I have now
added alt to each to remedy the issues when switching to file scoped namespaces
in C#.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, good or bad, changes, anything.
