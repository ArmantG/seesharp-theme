# SeeSharp-theme

A colorful, vibrant syntax theme specifically for C# language.
Pretty much just went with what I liked, what kept my eyes engaged and what made what I was doing look more interesting than it really was...

This is my 1st attempt - so there may be some issues...

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, good or bad, changes, anything.
